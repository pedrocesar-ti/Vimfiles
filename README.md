# vimfiles
After many years using vim, I decided to organize my knowledge and put my vimviles available. I haven't to many plugins and cofigurations done for now, mainly because I just started to configure a new machine with all my plugins again (but is hard to remember all!). No pain anymore.

<p align="center"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a99zsf9nwtk0qob/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-17%20at%2009.06.33.png"VimFiles"></p>

##Using

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/vimfiles.git ~/vimfiles
ln -s ~/vimfiles ~/.vim
ln -s ~/vimfiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc
vim +BundleInstall
```

Enjoy! :)
