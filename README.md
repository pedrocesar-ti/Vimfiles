# vimfiles
After many years using Vim and having to configurate all plugins over and over again every time that I decide to change my OS. I decided to organize and my vimfiles available. I haven't to many plugins and cofigurations done now (because I'm gonna update as needed). No pain anymore :sweat:.

##Installing
``console
$ wget https://github.com/pedrocesar-ti/vimfiles/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd vimfiles-master/
$ ./setup.sh
```

Enjoy! :)
